# SilviMetric Testing
Code for testing SilviMetric. Code is is the Python directory and uses the SilviMetric API.

Workflow1.py contains functions that should be useful to others wanting to apply Silvimetric to their data:
* scan_file_for_bounds()
* scan_for_bounds()
* scan_for_srs()
* build_pipeline()
* write_pipeline()

Documentation for these functions will be added later...
