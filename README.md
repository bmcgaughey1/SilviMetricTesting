# SilviMetric Testing
Code for testing [SilviMetric](https://github.com/hobuinc/silvimetric). Code is is the Python directory and uses the SilviMetric API.

smhelpers.py contains functions that should be useful to others wanting to apply Silvimetric to their data:
* scan_asset_for_bounds()
* scan_for_bounds()
* scan_for_srs()
* build_pipeline()
* write_pipeline()

Documentation for these functions will be added later...

Test workflows rely on data on a local computer (paths are hard coded). While this makes it nearly impossible for
someone else to run the code as-is, it doesn't negate the utility of the code to learn how to do simple processing.
